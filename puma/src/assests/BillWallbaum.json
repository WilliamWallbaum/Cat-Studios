Today's designer knows 3-d, video and motion graphics, vector design, social media management, UX/UI design and so much more. Over the past 15 years, I have learned so much, and continue to learn every day. I do it so when you come to me with the question 'Why should I choose you?' I can truly say 'I'm ready'. Together, we can go... beyond creative."
